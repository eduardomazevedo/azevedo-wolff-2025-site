# Interactive "Moral Hazard" Dashboard

This directory contains an interactive HTML dashboard to visualize the "Principal Problem" from Azevedo Wolff (2025).

## Files

-   `generate_data.py`: A Python script that pre-bakes the model solutions across a grid of parameters and saves them to `model_data.js`.
-   `model_data.js`: A static JSON file (wrapped in JavaScript) containing the pre-computed model solutions. This file is generated by `generate_data.py`.
-   `dashboard.html`: The standalone HTML file that loads `model_data.js` and uses JavaScript (Plotly.js) to render interactive charts.

## How to use

1.  **Generate data:**
    Ensure you are in the project root directory `/Users/eduaze/projects/azevedo-wolff-2025`.
    Run the following commands to generate the necessary data file:

    ```bash
    # Install dependencies (if not already installed in the root .venv)
    uv pip install numpy "git+https://github.com/eduardomazevedo/moralhazard.git"

    # Run the data generation script
    uv run python interactive_dashboard/generate_data.py
    ```

    This will create `interactive_dashboard/model_data.js`.

2.  **Open the dashboard:**
    Open the `interactive_dashboard/dashboard.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by navigating to the file in your file explorer and double-clicking it, or by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    open interactive_dashboard/dashboard.html
    ```

    (Note: `open` is a macOS command. On Linux, you might use `xdg-open` or `sensible-browser`; on Windows, `start`.)

3.  **Interact with the dashboard:**
    Once opened, you can use the "Case Selection" dropdown to choose different scenarios and the "Reservation Wage" slider to instantly update the plots.
